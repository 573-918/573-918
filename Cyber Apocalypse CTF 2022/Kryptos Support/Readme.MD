I first proceeded to start the Docker for this challenge;

<img src= "./kryptos start.png">

I then visited the homepage of the web application;

<img src= "./kryptos homepage.png">

As you can see in the picture above we have an input field for text;
I also can see there is a "backend" link which is clickable;
I visit the page to see what it is and what it does;

<img src= "./kryptos login.png">

Here we have a field for credentials to be filled out for logging in;
I dont have anything to fill out here and i am not allowedto brute force my way in :D ;
